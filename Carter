Hi Carter, work on adding all the keywords to this page. we need an entry for each page on the website. I made the frame for you but you will need to add
all the presenters, organizers, and all the pages in the for participants section. Try to think of any possible thing a guest might search up. Feel free
to use any resources you need (GPT, google, all the information in the bios and stuff). You might be able to feed gpt the bios and ask it for 5 keywords.
Always have the names as key words. Let me know if you need anything!!!

    const searchIndex = [
      { title: "Home", url: "index.html", keywords: "conference homepage" },
      { title: "About", url: "about.html", keywords: "about theme mission" },
      { title: "Nomination", url: "nomination.html", keywords: "blank blank blank" },
      { title: "Program", url: "program.html", keywords: "schedule sessions panels workshop dinner lunch breakfast food banquet" },
